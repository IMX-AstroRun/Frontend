# AstroRun - an iOS mobile game leveraging ImmutableX

AstroRun is a hyper casual iOS mobile game set in lower orbit. The astronaut, whose asset file is an NFT, moves past asteroids by manoeuvring on top of them and changing his gravity. The objective is stay alive for as long as possible and collect in-game IMX coins.

## How does it work?

AstroRun is an iOS mobile game, hence exploring a niche, but very accessible market that can onboard more users onto Web3 gaming. The app connects to the MetaMask app on one’s phone, therefore seamlessly integrating one’s Wallet into the mobile app. Through the app, one can play the infinite runner game, view one’s assets, and visit a Marketplace with a buy and sell functionality. The objective of the game is to stay alive for as long as possible by jumping between different asteroids and collecting coins, increasing one’s score.

ImmutableX acts as the perfect platform for minting, buying and selling NFTs for in-game assets due its practically non-existent gas fees. The iOS game is also built on top of Immutable’s Core and Wallet SDK’s which allow for simple and swift integration.
